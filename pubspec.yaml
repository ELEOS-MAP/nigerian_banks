  # To add assets to your plugin package, add an assets section, like this:
#  assets:
#    - assets/images/
#    - assets/banks.json
#  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  #
  # For details regarding assets in packages, see

  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:

  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf

  #   - family: Trajan Pro
